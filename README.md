🎵 RevPlay – Console-Based Music Streaming Application

📌 Application Overview

RevPlay is a console-based music streaming application developed using Java that simulates the core features of a real-world music streaming platform.
It allows users to explore songs, artists, albums, playlists, and podcasts, manage favorites, track listening history, and simulate music playback via a text-based interface.

The application also supports Musician / Artist roles, enabling artists to upload songs, create albums, manage profiles, and view play statistics.

RevPlay is built using a modular, layered architecture, making it scalable and extensible for future enhancement into a web or microservices-based application.
